** Copying files;; pretty simple go to your $PCSX2_CONFIG and copy the the textures folder from this directory to your PCSX2 CONFIG

$PCSX2_CONFIG depends on your Opreating system.

Note For mac : You cant acess it directly from finder, you have to go and "Search it" 
For Mac it is Library/Application Support/PCSX2/**(This is where the textures go)**



** Enabling MODS
Since we cannot use JSGME, We have to copy these files manually;; It's really easy

To enable copy the MOD   from the MODS/THE_MOD_YOU_WANT/textures/SLUS-20919/replacements/zall to $PCSX2_CONFIG textures/SLUS-20919/replacements/zall/


So for Controller_Xbox_Buttons (Atleast on Arch Linux)


I go into $THIS_DIR (The directory your reading this file from)

Make sure you already have copied the textures into $PCSX2_CONFIG (For me this is .config/PCSX2)

Then i go into MODS/Controller_Xbox_Buttons/textures/SLUS-20919/replacements/zall/

Copy all the files from this directory (Should be a bunch of pngs, then copy them to you $PCSX2_CONFIG/textures/SLUS-20919/replacements/zall  and overwrite the PS2 Buttons.


Hope you get the key concepts of Texture replacement in PCSX2, and atleast now you can show some knowledge and do this by yourself.
